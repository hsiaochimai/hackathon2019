# DryFi

 DryFi is an application that utilizes IOT technology, to help you be more environmentally conscience and save energy and money by drying your clothes less.

## Description
The United States is a large consumer of energy. We are the 2nd top consumer of energy by country in the world. But of the top 5 consumers, the average person in America utilizes more than 4,500 kWh per year *more* than the closest per capita rate. 

The average dryer uses about 200 kWh of energy per year when run only once a week. To help North Americans make more sustainable decisions, DryFi aims help the average person cut their dryer usage time by helping plan out when to hang their clothes out to dry..

* Utilization of the Adafruit Feather Huzzah to detect the temperature in your home
